This thesis has made contributions towards side-channel security in networked systems.
We introduced NetShaper, a modular, portable and scalable side-channel mitigation system that can be deployed without requiring modifications to the end hosts.
NetShaper's modular architecture enables a user to easily modify NetShaper to suit their application requirements.
By combining the traffic flow of multiple clients into one secure stream, NetShaper can reduce the effective per-flow overhead, thus ensuring optimised use of the available bandwidth.

Furthermore, we showed that side-channel attacks in PCIe are feasible even with newer generations of PCIe that double the bandwidth provided by previous generations.
Our work also established that an attacker can infer the presence of victim traffic even when the combined bandwidth usage of the victim and the attacker remains below saturation.
