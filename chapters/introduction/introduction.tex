\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

Today, we live in a connected world where various network links are used to transmit and receive a lot of data. 
This data can be a webpage or video being streamed by a user on the internet. 
It can also be an image or a machine learning model being sent from the CPU to the GPU for processing. 
Given the extensive scale at which data is transmitted, ensuring its security and privacy during transit is of paramount importance.

To protect data that is in transit, we have come to rely on encryption. 
Most encryption mechanisms today rely on mathematical functions that transform the plaintext into a ciphertext. 
Only an entity with the correct key can decipher the ciphertext back into plaintext. 
As such, encryption effectively conceals the content of the data that is in transit.

While encryption protects the content of the data in transit, it does not conceal the metadata corresponding to the transmission.
Metadata, such as packet sizes and timings, are visible to any adversary with access to the shared network link.
Prior work has demonstrated that in some applications, this metadata is strongly correlated with the data being transmitted and, hence, can inadvertently leak the contents of the transmission.
For example, attackers on the internet can identify the video a user is streaming \cite{schuster2017beautyburst} or the webpage they are visiting \cite{gong2010fingerprinting, wang2014supersequence}.
Even when the data is being transmitted on an interconnect within a computer (e.g. from a CPU to a GPU or NIC), the corresponding metadata can reveal the user's text input or even the machine learning model being trained \cite{tan2021invisible}.
In the literature, such attacks are commonly known as network side-channel attacks.

Network side channels have been studied extensively in Internet networks.
They can be used to classify the type of data being transferred \cite{shapira2019flowpic}, determine the website a client is visiting \cite{bhat2019varcnn, dyer2012peek, hayes2016kfp, sirinam2018df}, the video that a user is streaming \cite{schuster2017beautyburst}, what they are speaking on a video or VoIP call \cite{white2011phonotactic}, or even for covert communication \cite{barradas2020poking}.
These attacks have also been explored to a limited extent in data centre networks.
For example, they can be used as covert channels to exfiltrate data out \cite{tahir2016sneak}.
Similarly, there has been limited exploration of network side channels in on and off-chip networks. 
These can be used for website fingerprinting, \cite{tan2021invisible, side2022lockeddown}, determining user input \cite{tan2021invisible, rodrigues2024busted} or revealing the workload on an FPGA or GPU \cite{tan2021invisible, giechaskiel2022cross, fang2023gotcha}.
They can also be used for covert channel communication \cite{khaliq2021timing, giechaskiel2022cross, side2022lockeddown, dutta2023spy}.

To defend against network side-channel attacks in Internet and datacenter networks, several solutions have been proposed. 
However, many of the proposed defences rely only on simulations and do not provide concrete mitigation systems \cite{abusnaina2020dfd, cai2014tamaraw, gong2022surakav, hou2020wf, juarez2016wtfpad, nasr2021blind, rahman2020mockingbird, shan2021dolos, wang2014supersequence, wright2009morphing}.
Of those that do provide concrete systems, some are not easily deployable \cite{cai2014csbuflo, mehta2022pacer, smith2022qcsd, wang2017walkie}, do not scale well with an increasing number of end hosts \cite{luo2011httpos, cai2014csbuflo, smith2022qcsd, wang2017walkie, cherubin2017llama, barradas2017deltashaper}, or do not support a variety of applications \cite{luo2011httpos, wang2017walkie, cherubin2017llama}.
% For example, some solutions require end-host modifications and do not scale well with the number of clients \cite{cai2014csbuflo, cherubin2017llama, luo2011httpos, smith2022qcsd, wang2017walkie, mehta2022pacer}. 
% Cs-BUFLO \cite{cai2014csbuflo} relies on OpenSSH and requires modifying the OpenSSH library on the end host. 
% Walkie-talkie \cite{wang2017walkie} relies on a modification to the browser of the client.
% Pacer \cite{mehta2022pacer} requires modification to the hypervisor and the kernel of the guest VM.
% Others are either not application agnostic or do not adapt to the bandwidth and latency requirements of the application \cite{cherubin2017llama, luo2011httpos, barradas2017deltashaper}.

Network side-channel attacks in interconnects have received far less attention.
Most prior work relies on systems that are slow or highly constrained.
Invisible Probe \cite{tan2021invisible} and Locked Down \cite{side2022lockeddown} both rely on PCIe v3.0, which offers half the bandwidth of PCIe v4.0.
Invisible Probe \cite{tan2021invisible} and the FPGA-based attack by \citet{giechaskiel2022cross} both rely on creating contention in a PCIe switch or PCH that has multiple downlinks but only one uplink, resulting in the ability to easily create congestion.
The work by \citet{khaliq2021timing} relies on an out-of-date desktop CPU that is highly constrained to create contention.

In this thesis, we first present a modular, portable and scalable network side-channel mitigation system called NetShaper 
\footnote{NetShaper is both the name of a differential-privacy-based framework and a system that implements the framework. This thesis focuses on the NetShaper system.} \cite{sabzi2024netshaper}.
Second, we demonstrate additional avenues that can be used to carry out side-channel attacks in interconnects and their caveats.
