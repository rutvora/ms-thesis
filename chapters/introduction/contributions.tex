- In this thesis, we first present a modular, portable and scalable network side-channel mitigation system called NetShaper, and second, we demonstrate additional avenues that can be used to carry out side-channel attacks in interconnects and their caveats.

Concrete Contributions:
- We first demonstrate how to build a scalable, modular, and portable middlebox-based proxy solution that can defend against side-channel attacks
    - Modular proxy architecture
    - Portability of the application (easily deployable, with no complicated system modifications necessary)
    - use of QUIC for aggregated streams
- We also demonstrate avenues with which one can generate contention in the PCIe controller buffers, which are a building block to carry out a side-channel attack
    - Using CPU-issued instructions (stores)
    - Mechanism to measure async stores that are issued in an OOO processor
        - This includes reverse engineering the AMD CPU architecture (and diagram)
    - Using cudaMemcpy
