\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:netshaper-evaluation}

We evaluate NetShaper on a variety of performance metrics.
First, we evaluate the peak line rate that NetShaper can support. 
Next, we evaluate the maximum throughput that the NetShaper middlebox can sustain.
Then, we measure the latency that NetShaper's middlebox will incur without any traffic shaping.
And finally, we measure the relation between NetShaper's latency and $W$ when traffic is being shaped.
