\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:netshaper-evaluation}

In our evaluation, we answer the following questions:
(i) Does NetShaper limit the bandwidth utilisation of the underlying network link?
(ii) How many packets can NetShaper process per second?
(iii) Does NetShaper throttle the end host application?
(iv) What is the latency incurred by NetShaper (in relation to window $W$)?
(v) How many parallel clients can NetShaper support?
