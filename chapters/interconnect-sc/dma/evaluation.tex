\subsection{Using DMA operations to observe presence/absence of victim traffic on PCIe}
\label{subsec:interconnect-sc-dma-evaluation}

Now that we know that the PCIe bandwidth can be saturated with 4MB transfers, we can use this information to craft an adversary that can create congestion in the non-hierarchical PCIe link.
To achieve this, we use the pseudo-code outlined in \Cref{lst:timing-victim-with-dma}.
We assume that the victim is also transferring data to/from the GPU via DMA.

To evaluate our ability to detect victim traffic, we run the adversary for $10^4$ iterations.
At the same time, we execute the victim, which repeatedly (for $10^3$ iterations) performs a DMA transfer of either 4KB or 4MB
As before, we synchronise the execution of the critical code sections responsible for data transfers between the victim and the adversary. 

As shown in \Cref{fig:dma-contention-4mb}, the time it takes to complete the call to \textit{cudaMemcpy} increases in the presence of victim traffic and reduces once the victim stops transmitting.
As such, an adversary is able to determine the presence/absence of victim traffic.

We also explore if the adversary can determine this without saturating the PCIe bandwidth.
For this, we follow the same pseudo-code in \Cref{lst:timing-victim-with-dma}, but set the transfer size of the adversary to 4KB.
As shown in \Cref{fig:dma-contention-4kb}, the adversary can still observe the presence or absence of the victim traffic.
