Invisible Probe \cite{tan2021invisible} was the first work to study the security implications of congestion on PCIe.
However, their approach required a hierarchical PCIe topology with a shared PCIe switch or PCH and depended on the attacker saturating the PCIe bandwidth to induce congestion on the PCIe switch or PCH.
\citet{giechaskiel2022cross} follows the same approach as Invisible Probe.
They also attempt to saturate the upstream PCIe bandwidth on a PCIe switch, thus inducing contention on the PCIe switch.
LockedDown \cite{side2022lockeddown} shares the system setup with our work, where the GPU is directly connected to the host.
They also use the DMA controllers on the GPU to transfer data to/from the CPU and create contention.
In contrast, our work shows that the attacker does not need to saturate the PCIe bandwidth to observe contention with the victim's traffic. 
Furthermore, our work establishes that contention can occur even when the combined bandwidth usage of the victim and the attacker remains below saturation.
