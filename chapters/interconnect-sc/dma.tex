\section{Generating contention via DMA}
\label{sec:interconnect-sc-dma}

In this section, we discuss how an adversary can use direct memory access (DMA) to create contention in the buffers of a PCIe controller.
We revisit \textbf{RQ1} to determine if an adversary can use this approach to observe the victim's traffic pattern. 
In addition, we also provide an answer to \textbf{RQ2} by demonstrating that an adversary can create congestion on a non-hierarchical PCIe 4.0 link.

A DMA controller can generate memory addresses and initiate memory \textit{load} or \textit{store} instructions that are executed in parallel, independent of the execution units of the CPU.
The DMA controller receives commands specifying the source and destination addresses and the size of the data to copy.
Once the data transfer is complete, it issues a notification of completion to the command issuer.
As such, DMA controllers like those on Nvidia GPUs provide a mechanism to measure only the completion time of the entire DMA transfer, not the completion time of individual \textit{load} or \textit{store} instructions.
