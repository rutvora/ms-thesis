\section{Generating contention via CPU instructions}
\label{sec:interconnect-sc-store-ops}

There are two major ways one can generate traffic on the PCIe link: 
1) CPU load/store instructions on memory-mapped PCIe device memory, I/O or configuration address space, and 
2) Direct memory access (DMA) to copy data between the PCIe device memory and the DRAM.
In this section, we discuss how to use CPU instructions to generate the traffic and defer the discussion of generating traffic via DMA to \Cref{sec:interconnect-sc-dma}.

An adversary can generate traffic from the CPU by mapping a PCIe device resource to an application running on the CPU and issuing load or store operations on the mapped memory.
Each load/store operation will be buffered in the PCIe controller until a transaction layer packet (TLP) is generated and ready to be transmitted.
The actual transmission time of the packet is influenced by two factors:
1) The ordering of the packets, as outlined in \Cref{tab:pcie-transaction-ordering-rules}, and
2) The number of pending packets that are not subject to any ordering rules relative to the current packet.
If the packets do not have any relative ordering rule, it is reasonable to assume that the controller follows a simple first come, first serve policy.
As such, any packet generated by the adversary can either be delayed due to the presence of existing traffic in the buffer or not be delayed, as there is no traffic in the buffer.
This allows the attacker to observe the presence or absence of victim traffic without necessarily saturating the PCIe bandwidth.


To observe the victim traffic, the attacker always needs to have at least one packet pending in the PCIe controller, which can be delayed by the presence of the victim traffic.
The attacker also needs to ensure that the packet can not be delayed because of their own traffic.
To achieve these goals, the attacker needs to determine the correct combination of the PCIe resource and instruction, as different instructions on different resources can lead to different PCIe transactions and transaction ordering rules.
