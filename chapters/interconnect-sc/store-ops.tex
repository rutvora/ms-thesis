\section{Generating contention via CPU instructions}
\label{sec:interconnect-sc-store-ops}

To generate traffic from the CPU, the attacker can map a resource of the PCIe device to an application running on the CPU and then issue load or store operations on that mapped memory.
However, different PCIe resources and different instructions (i.e. load or store) result in different types of transactions on PCIe.

As outlined in \Cref{tab:pcie-transaction-types}, most PCIe transactions are non-posted and, hence, are synchronous.
The synchronous behaviour enforces that no two load/store (i.e. read or write) operations to the same PCIe region can be issued in parallel.
However, having multiple parallel transactions in flight is essential for the attacker to maintain one pending packet in the PCIe buffer as the attacker can measure the delay in the transmission of this packet to infer the presence or absence of victim traffic. 
As such, the attacker can only rely on non-posted transactions, and in particular, memory write operations
\footnote{While messages are also non-posted, they are usually generated by the underlying hardware directly, and the user has no control over those messages}.
