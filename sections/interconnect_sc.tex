\chapter{Side Channel Attacks in Interconnects}

This chapter describes some avenues that can be used to carry out a side-channel attack on interconnects like PCIe and the challenges in pursuing those approaches.
In order to carry out a side-channel attack on PCIe, the first obvious step is to be able to transmit some data on the interconnect.
There are two major ways to achieve this: loads/stores on PCIe memory or configuration mapped to the CPU's address space or using DMA from the PCIe device to copy data to/from the CPU memory.
We describe the first approach in \Cref{sec:contention-with-stores}, and the second approach in \Cref{sec:contention-with-cudamemcpy}.

Should we consider the pre-microcode-update results and talk about that? It is NOT a vulnerability, just a behavioural observation. Hence, I don't think we need responsible disclosure
