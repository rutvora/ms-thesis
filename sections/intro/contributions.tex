\section{Thesis Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

In this thesis, we demonstrate that one can build a network side-channel mitigation system that provides provable privacy guarantees and is scalable and adaptive to the current traffic. In addition, we also demonstrate that saturating the network bandwidth is not necessary to carry out a practical network side-channel attack. First, we present NetShaper \cite{sabzi2024netshaper}, a scalable and adaptive network side-channel mitigation system that provides differential privacy guarantees. Second, we present a system that can observe the victim's traffic shape on the PCIe interconnect without saturating the PCIe bandwidth.
