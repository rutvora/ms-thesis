\section{Thesis Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

In this thesis, we first demonstrate NetShaper, a scalable, modular, and portable system designed to mitigate network side-channel attacks on the Internet. 
NetShaper relies on a Differential-Privacy (DP)-based framework for mitigating network side-channel attacks 
(also named NetShaper \footnote{For the rest of this thesis, we use NetShaper to refer to the system and specify explicitly when referring to the framework}) 
developed by my colleague Amir Sabzi.
Second, we present a system that can observe the victim's traffic shape on the PCIe interconnect without saturating the PCIe bandwidth.
