\chapter{Background}

% We begin this chapter by discussing the problem of network side-channel attacks in \Cref{sec:ns-attacks}, in the context of two distinct applications: video streaming and web services.
% In \Cref{sec:dp-background}, we present a comprehensive definition of differential privacy (DP), outline its key properties, and highlight its primary applications, thereby setting the foundation for our differentially private traffic shaping mechanism.
% In \Cref{sec:background-quic} we provide a brief overview of the QUIC protocol, which plays a pivotal role in the design of {\sys}.
% Finally, in \Cref{sec:threat-model}, we conclude this chapter by explaining our threat model.
