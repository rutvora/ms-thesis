%% LaTeX's \includeonly commands causes any uses of \include{} to only
%% include files that are in the list.  This is helpful to produce
%% subsets of your thesis (e.g., for committee members who want to see
%% the dissertation chapter by chapter).  It also saves time by 
%% avoiding reprocessing the entire file.
