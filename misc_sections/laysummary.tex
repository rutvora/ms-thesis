\paragraph{} Communication networks, whether the internet or hardware interconnects like PCIe (which connect components inside a computer), play a crucial role in modern computing. 
Although they operate at different levels, both are used to transfer data and can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks, which leak unintended information.

This research looks at security risks in both types of networks and explores their similarities. 
The first part focuses on reducing side-channel attacks in internet-like networks with a scalable solution that allows users to balance security with performance trade-offs like latency and bandwidth. 
The second part examines whether similar attacks can happen in PCIe interconnects.

By drawing similarities between the two types of attacks, we provide a unified perspective on securing communication networks against side-channel threats.
