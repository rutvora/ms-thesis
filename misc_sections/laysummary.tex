\paragraph{} 
Communication networks play a crucial role in modern computing, whether they connect two machines on opposite ends of the world (i.e., using the Internet) or two components in your laptop (i.e., using an interconnect). 
No matter the scale of the communication network, it is paramount to ensure the security and privacy of the data being transmitted.
While encryption secures the content of data, it does not hide the behaviour of the traffic itself.
A malicious observer can monitor this traffic behaviour and recover the contents of the encrypted transmission.
We refer to this observability as a \textit{side channel}.

We examine security risks that emerge in both the Internet and interconnect networks.
We first present a solution that makes side channel exploitation impossible in Internet networks.
Our solution provides the users with the ability to trade-off between security and performance.
Then, we present new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an adversary for a side-channel attack in interconnects.
